    <b> Q1. -- What are the differences between Site Specific art work and the idea of Art Interventions? </b><br><br>
    Site-specific art is art that is designed for a particular location. If taken out of that location, it loses all or almost all of its essence and meaning. Site specific art transforms the site or location it is present in. In contrast, art interventions are pieces of work that are designed specifically to interact with an existing structure or situation. It could be an audience, another artwork, or even in the public domain.<br><br>
    <b> Q2. -- Choose 2 of the 4 artists shared and Answer the following for each artist. </b><br><br>
    <b> A. -- Take one or more of the art works from the listed artists and please describe how a piece(s) function as site specific work or an intervention. Please provide context and examples to explain your answer. </b><br><br>
    <b> B. -- For the same piece(s), explain your interpretation of the work. What does it mean to you? </b><br><br>
    Walter de Maria’s Earth Room is a site specific piece located in Soho. The site specificity of the Earth room offers a journey-like experience to the audience. It requires the viewer to enter from one of the busiest and most cosmopolitan cities in the world into a specific space. It is installed in a space where very little open soil or earth is available to see. The room is to be experienced only at that specific location with the specific sensory details of that area. However, there are images of the room online. Though defeating the visual sensory experience, this does not change its site specific nature. If the Earth Room were to be relocated, the sense of space would become distorted. The auditory experience is unique to the sounds of the city, to Wooster Street, and what filters into the room from there. The smell, and touch of the room is singular to that one location. The surroundings are what bring the Earth Room to life. <br><br>
    The deliberateness of the Earth Room is intriguing to me. When I first heard about a room full of dirt, I pondered why the piece would be so intriguing to experience. Without the location, the art looses meaning. To the artist, that work belongs there. It is deliberately and intentionally placed so that the location enhances the rooms experience.<br><br>
    The Phoenix of the Martyrs is specific to Martyrs Square in Lebanon as it commemorates a protest specific to that location and uses materials from that space and time. The artist was present at the time and created this art in that space. There is irreplicable symbolism to this installation.<br><br>
    The article ended with the quote, "and today, I don't own it anymore… it's for the streets.” Personally, I think this describes site-specific art, especially The Pheonix. The piece commemorates the protest and millions of individuals who participated and were effected by it. The people of Lebanon brings life to the piece, and the community is one of the most valuable parts of a location. <br><br>

     <b> Q3. -- What is the single most important that all signs must share to be relevant and effective? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home. This is NOT about aesthetics or constuction, but just functionality of the idea. </b><br><br>
    The answer was supposed to be that a sign is site specific. However, the question wording was slightly confusing. Might I suggest, “What makes a sign effective? For example, when looking at bathroom signs, what is it about that specific sign that tells a person where the bathroom is?” <br><br>
    <b> Q4. --What Kind of art, (not shown here), have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description and provide 1 image for reference. </b><br><br>
  An example of a site specific art piece that I have been to is the Yoda Fountain located at Lucasfilm in San Francisco. Yoda is a character in Star Wars which is made by Lucasfilm. The minute you enter the site of the fountain, you truly feel like you have escaped to a galaxy far far away.  <br><br>
