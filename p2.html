    <b> Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not? </b><br><br>
     A system is a set of interconnecting components that come together to create a network or mechanism. Any grouping that does not have components or where the components do not affect each other is not a system.<br><br>
    <b> Q2. -- For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case. </b><br><br>
     There are four definitions of a system. These definitions include modularity, decomposability, emergence, and chaos theory. Modularity is a property of systems where parts of the system can be rearranged in a variety of ways. An example of modularity is Legos or computer parts like a graphic card. Decomposability is the point at which elements of a system are so broken down that doing so any further would cause malfunction. An example of decomposability is water. Water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen; however, decomposing it further would be irrelevant to the system. Emergence is when a simple interactivity of parts displays complex behavior. An example of emergence is ants colonizing. Lastly, chaos theory looks at patterns and laws of dynamic systems that are incredibly sensitive to original conditions. An example of chaos theory is the butterfly effect. Changing smaller events can snowball into larger outcomes. In chaos theory, there is a range of outcomes but not an infinite number of outcomes.<br><br>
     <b> Q3. -- What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other? </b><br><br>
     Tessellations are geometric shapes that are repeated to cover a plane of tiles without gaps. The result is a mosaic-type pattern that is derived from a set of rules based on mathematical calculations. On the other hand, modularity has to do with the division of systems into smaller parts that can be independently created, replaced, modified, or exchanged. Modularity focuses on interchangeable parts that when rearranged do not affect the outcome of the system. Tessellations, on the other hand, include a variety of different results when rearranged. <br><br>
    <b> Q4. -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic) </b><br><br>
    Complex systems are a type of chaotic system. They display self-organization which then leads to complex adaptive behavior. Self-organization is when elements of a system come together to achieve a goal. The formed teams are nonlinear and may work for some time, then fall apart, only to reconstitute in a different form. This forming, falling apart then reforming is a complex adaptive behavior. Uniform systems, on the other hand, remain the same, can be patterned, and are linear. <br><br>
  <b>  Q5. -- What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug. Please explain in complete sentances.</b><br><br>
    A system diagram is a diagram that shows boundaries between a system or an individual part of a system, its environment, and the components that interact with it. An exploded-view drawing is a diagram that shows the relationship or order of assembly of an object with different parts. Other diagrams do not express systems.  <br><br> </p>

       <figcaption> Emergence: This global internet map displays the emergence of a system. Simple things within our world, like prices and exchanges, come together to create a much larger global system that, in the end, is all interconnected. In the event that internet traffic goes up when the prices and the exchanges go up, it would result in economic growth.
