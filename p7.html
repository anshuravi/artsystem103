    <b> Q1. --From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinosaurs really looked like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this affect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.
 </b><br><br>
 Initially, dinosaurs were depicted as giant, slow cold-blooded reptiles that were evolutionary failures destined for extinction. As a result, most paintings and depictions were that they were not moving or moving very slowly. Their bodies were poking masses of flesh in dull gray shades. In the 1960s they were very sad depictions. As time went by, the excavation of the deinonychus showed that they lived in packs (4 were discovered) and their skeletal structure showed that they were deft, agile, and quick creatures. The anatomy showed that they were more like deft birds or a road runner. Born from this excavation and further studies and drawing it was clear that these prehistoric beasts had lithe muscular bodies and were even warm-blooded. Along with all this factual research were brilliant visuals that no longer depicted dinosaurs as large swamp living creatures but more as track stars that lived in social interaction. <br><br>
    <b> Q2. -- The artist/archaeologist John Conway who is doing interpretations of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative-based disciplines, and forms of studies use similar techniques that remind you of this method or process? Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.
 </b><br><br>

 A creative field that uses interpretations of reality while taking liberties is game design. Assassin’s Creed is a historical fiction video game that interprets historical events. We may not know how ancient Egypt or Renaissance Italy may have looked, but we do have historical maps and accounts. From these, game developers have extrapolated and built live models, allowing players to walk through and explore these historical environments.

Another example is fossils. Fossils require a large amount of interpretation to explore events that happened in the past. Finding a fossil is like finding an artifact that has to be explored through speculative stories. <br><br>
<a href="https://3d.si.edu/collections/hominin-fossils"> Here is the link to a Fossil database.</a> <br><br>
     <b> Q3. First, summarize in your own words the definition of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second and fourth articles. Then, given the examples in the second article and the other examples provided of possible future products, how can 'Material Speculation' also be used to create speculative objects that refer to the past? What might be an example of a fictional object from the past, that creates the same dynamic of speculation?
 </b><br><br>
 Material speculation explores artifacts that inform us of something about the world that they come from. The physical artifact comes from a nonexistent world. Material speculation deals with possible worlds. The contrast between the actual versus possible worlds and the counterfactual are all parts of material speculation.
 <br><br>
 The reading explored the Obscura1C, a digital camera made of concrete. To access its photographs, one has to destroy the camera to access the digital content. This is counterintuitive to the current world of constant availability.
 <br><br>
 Another from the reading is The Mediated Bodysuit. The suit is a symbiotic system that transforms touch or sense into music. The performer is a musical instrument that can be played by touch. It counters the current fact that the human body is not a technical interface and headphones are personal to a person’s personal space.
<br><br>
Any recreation of historical cities creates a sense of speculation. There is a 3D simulation of Ancient Rome that the general public can walk through. Society may not know exactly how Ancient Rome looked like, but thanks to material speculation we can recreate some of the artifacts from this era.
