         <h5> Pass 1 </h5>
		<p>
	We started out making individual petra stars out of origami triangles. Following this, we took apart each one of our petra stars and brought them together. We alternated our triangle pieces and placed them in a different arrangement from the original petra star to illustrate modularity. Our final design resembled a question mark. Along with petra stars, we each brought in origami triangles to create a variations of origami swans. These pieces were modular as well, aiding us in creating multiple variations of the swan. We varied the swan head and the swan tail feathers.

Continuing our journey of learning systems and modularity, we created tessellations. Tessellations are geometric shapes that are repeated to cover a plane of tiles without gaps. Each of us created triangular shapes with a protruding, unique side, a subtraction of the unique side, and one common side. Getting a hang of the concept of tessellations took some time, and mistakes were made. For example, in my first design, I merely mirrored the unique design on the opposite side instead of subtracting it from the piece. However, with a few tries, we perfected our designs and were able to put our pieces together, both seperatly and as a group. They are color coded per person. I, Anshu Ravi's are in light purple and light orange, Michelle Quan's are in green, Richard Nubla's are in red, and Chienyu Chen's are in dark purple, bright orange and pink.

   After we created paper tessellations, we went digital. Using Adobe Illustrator, we created new tessellations. These tessellations used the same formula, with each of us creating a shape with a protruding, unique side, a subtraction of the unique side, and one common side. Since we were familar with tessellations and how they worked, this time it was much easier to create the shapes. Using the unite and minus functions in the pathfinder of illustrator, we created our shapes. After creating the shapes, we brought them together and arranged them in order to test if they were truly tessellations. They are color coded per person. I, Anshu Ravi's are in purple, Michelle Quan's are in blue, Richard Nubla's are green, and Chienyu Chen's are red. As a final test, we ran our digital designs through a laser cutter and cut our designs out in wood. To our enlightened surprise, they worked the first time we printed.

         <h4> Phase 2 </h4>
		<p>
     Our group evenly split types of fasteners, with Michelle and I doing Option A, and Chienyu and Richard doing Option B. Michelle and I, focused on paper-based fasteners like tabs and slots. We created kirigami 3D shapes with modular pieces. These were much easier to learn than Option B. The paper made the fasteners more malleable. On the other hand, Chienyu and Richard, focused on foam board-based fasteners, creating boxes with dovetails and finger joints. They had to correlate the fastener thickness with that of the foam board, making the fastener design harder to make. Overall, the process helped me personally understand how fasteners worked. When we placed all our groups fasteners together, it helped us get an overview of the different types of fasteners we could use helping us come up with a variety of ideas for the final pass of the project.

 <h4> Phase 3 </h4>
 <p>
  After completing our hand-cut fasteners, we started to transfer the techniques we learned into Adobe Illustrator. As a group we divided up different fasteners with Michelle doing paper tabs and slots, myself doing wood notches, Chienyu doing paper notches, and Richard doing dovetails. After we modeled the fasteners in Illustrator, we created three different versions, each with the fastener model slightly different in order to Goldilocks test them. Personally, this was the hardest step of the process, as I scaled my original design and as a result, the notches were too thin to even fit the wood. However, after a second try and without scaling, my fastener notches worked fine.

<h4> Artist Statement </h4>
<p>
Coming together and combining everything we had learned in the past few weeks, MARC decided to put on a fashion show. Our original ideas revolved around a “pick and choose” style of multiple pieces with a common base. We tested baristas and bartenders, but those did not fit quite right. Then, we came up with the idea of outfits and fashion. We all adored the idea but struggled to visualize how we would execute this. The first thing we discussed was the material, which we decided on wood as acrylic was expensive and harder to get a hold of. I tested wood notches for the Goldilocks tests and discovered that notches would not work as the outfits would be perpendicular to the body and not parallel. Richard tested dovetails on wood, however, those would also not work as they laid flat. Scrapping both those ideas, we decided to use pegs as fasteners instead. Our next step was to create an Illustrator file, divide up the shapes, and model them out. Splitting them up, I, Anshu, did shirts and wings, Michelle did pants, Chienyu did hats and shoes, and Richard did accessories, coats, and the bases. For my pieces, I wanted to explore a variety of styles of shirts. I struggled a little trying to understand the Illustrator interface, as previously I had only used the shape functions and never the pen tool. However, I quickly learned. Starting with a basic t-shirt and tank top, I started modeling out different patterns. As a cosplayer, I modeled the two armor-like shirts from the tank top. My last two tops were inspired by Halloween, with witchy sleeves. After we modeled the shapes, Chienyu and Michelle laser-cut the files. Michelle took all the pieces home and painted them over the weekend. The next week, we realized the pieces were a little rough around the edges and could cause splinters, Michelle, with the help of Chienyu and I helped to cover them in a layer of mod podge. This was also the day I created an instruction schema, and Richard put together the stage. I wanted the schema to feel like an instruction manual that you would find along with this product when you bought it. I put together an outfit, documenting the pieces in each step of the process of putting it on a mannequin. Realizing that some of the pieces did not fit or were too small Michelle and I went to reprint them the next day. Together, Michelle and I painted these pieces and finished putting mod podge on them. After cutting, and painting, I put together some outfits, testing all the pieces to see if they worked as planned. Once the models were ready, we got ready for documentation and presentation. Once our outfits came together, we placed all the figures on the stage, and with some of my LED lights, we modeled them out. Richard then showed up to fully set up a backdrop. Then, Richard and Michelle took paparazzi pictures and videos. Meanwhile, I put together a slide deck of our process and design for presentation. MARC was ready to go live.
